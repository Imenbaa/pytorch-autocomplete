# Autocomplete with PyTorch and RNNs on Colaboratory

Despite the recent very impressive advances in deep learning such as [GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/), [BERT](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html) or [Nvidia's GAN-powered face generator](https://medium.com/syncedreview/gan-2-0-nvidias-hyperrealistic-face-generator-e3439d33ebaf), the most influential article about deep learning for me personally is Andrej Karpathyâ€˜s blog entry on [the unreasonable effectiveness of recurrent neural networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). When I first read the article almost four years ago, I was amazed of how easily these networks produce text passages which resemble the basic style patterns of e.g. a work by Shakespeare or Linux source code. However, when I tried to train my own recurrent neural networks (RNN), I quickly noticed that without a state-of-art GPU, my neural network sounded more like a toddler than like Shakespeare. 

While buying your own GPU might be too expensive to just play around with a few deep learning examples and setting up an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) instance might be too much of a hassle, there is an easy-to-use alternative: [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com), a hosted Python development environment that features free GPU (and [TPU](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/)) usage. This tutorial can be opened in Colaboratory by simply clicking on the following badge:

This tutorial aims to cover the complete workflow of a deep learning application, using only Google's computing and data storage resources. The content of this tutorial is inspried by Andrej Karpathy's examples: we will devise a recurrent neural network based on the deep learning framework `PyTorch` that is trained on topic-specific Python source code (e.g. code examples of `tensorflow` or `PyTorch` models) and subsequently serves as a helpful auto-complete function for coding.

To implement this application, we will learn to...
- connect the Colaboratoy notebook to Google Drive for data storage
- scrape training data from Github using automated search queries
- define a stacked LSTM recurrent neural network using PyTorch
- write a GPU-accelerated training routine with a live progress visualization
- integrate the trained model with the notebook environment to employ the auto-complete feature
